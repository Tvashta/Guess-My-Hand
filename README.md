brew install python-tk@3.X
```
For Windows, tkinter can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install tk

## Usage

To view all options use python Guess-my-Hand.py -h. Apart from seed, the other flags will be used for competition among different teams.
```bash
python Guess-my-Hand.py  [--seed] 
```

For running the simulation multiple times with different seeds use the Guess-my-Hand.py with --nSims flag set to the number of simulations.
```bash
python Guess-my-Hand.py  [--nSims] 
```
